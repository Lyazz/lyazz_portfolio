			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				The Weekly Activity Manager streamlines how engineering firms manage and evaluate their weekly operations.
				It centralizes activity reports submitted by engineers, technicians, and administrative staff — automatically generating summaries by employee and by project to support both performance evaluation and client invoicing.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Key Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Separate weekly report templates for technical and administrative personnel.</li>
				<li>Automated synthesis generation by employee (for HR review) and by project (for monthly invoicing by task and role).</li>
				<li>Centralized dashboard to track submissions, hours worked, and project-level activity.</li>
				<li>Smart validation detecting missing data, inconsistencies, and duplicates before synthesis.</li>
				<li>One-click export of curated synthesis files ready for accounting and HR analysis.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Flutter &amp; Dart with modern desktop UI components.</li>
				<li>Local database powered by SQLite (sqflite_ffi) for secure offline storage.</li>
				<li>Excel import/export via the <code>excel</code> package.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Operator Experience</h2>
			<p>
				Employees complete structured weekly reports at the start of each week, depending on their role.
				Managers can then view all submissions, validate data consistency, and generate automated syntheses for monthly client billing and employee evaluation.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Outcomes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Replaced manual Excel consolidation with automated, validated syntheses.</li>
				<li>Improved transparency and accuracy in project billing by role and task.</li>
				<li>Enhanced employee performance tracking through unified weekly reporting.</li>
			</ul>
